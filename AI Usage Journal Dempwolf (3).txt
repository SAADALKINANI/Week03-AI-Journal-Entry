AI Usage Journal
Saad Alkinani


This week I worked on the INST326 Week 3 function exercises. I mostly solved the problems on my own, but I used AI in a few places where I was stuck:

I asked for explanations of function basics like how to return values and how default parameters work.

I had it show me simple examples of string methods (.strip(), .title(), .lower()) so I could apply them to my own code.

When one of my early functions didn’t run, I used AI for debugging help — it pointed out that I had a missing return statement.

I made sure to write the actual solutions myself and just used AI to clear up small questions and double-check my logic.
